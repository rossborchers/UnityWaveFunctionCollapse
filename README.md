# UnityWaveFunctionCollapse

This has been adapted for unity from [mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)

It is a simplified alternative to [selfsame/unity-wave-function-collapse](https://github.com/selfsame/unity-wave-function-collapse) which operates on Texture2D's rather than game objects.
